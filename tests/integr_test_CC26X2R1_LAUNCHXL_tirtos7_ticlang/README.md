## Example Summary

This example shows how to use LightFiles library together with the Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) driver
to read and write data to off-chip external flash memory. The external SPI
flash is accessed by the NVS SPI driver.

## Peripherals & Pin Assignments

When this project is built, the SysConfig tool will generate the TI-Driver
configurations into the __ti_drivers_config.c__ and __ti_drivers_config.h__
files. Information on pins and resources used is present in both generated
files. Additionally, the System Configuration file (\*.syscfg) present in the
project may be opened with SysConfig's graphical user interface to determine
pins and resources used.

* `CONFIG_NVSEXTERNAL` - Non-volatile storage used by a NVS driver instance.

## BoosterPacks, Board Resources & Jumper Settings

For board specific jumper settings, resources and BoosterPack modifications,
refer to the __Board.html__ file.

> If you're using an IDE such as Code Composer Studio (CCS) or IAR, please
refer to Board.html in your project directory for resources used and
board-specific jumper settings.

The Board.html can also be found in your SDK installation:

        <SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/boards/<BOARD>

## Example Usage

* Step one.

* Step two.
